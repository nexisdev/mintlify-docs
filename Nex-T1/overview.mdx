<Info>
  **Nex‑T1** is a production‑grade AI agent platform for Web3 that unifies research, trading, and on‑chain execution behind one reliable API. It solves fragmented multi‑tool workflows by consolidating data sources (The Graph, Dune, DeFiLlama), market infrastructure (Chainlink, Binance), and execution adapters (Uniswap/0x, Thirdweb) with built‑in risk checks and guardrails. Power users, DeFi teams, and crypto traders get multi‑agent orchestration, MCP integrations across EVM/Solana/Bitcoin, and preview‑to‑execute flows to move from insight to action safely and fast.
