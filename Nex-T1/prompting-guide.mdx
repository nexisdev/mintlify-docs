# Prompting Guide

## System Prompt

- Location: `app/core/prompts.py`
- The agent in `app/core/langgraph/graph.py` injects the system prompt and binds tools.

## Tips

- Be explicit about intent and chain context.
  - “quote 10 USDC to WETH on Base (8453)”
- For research, specify sources and limits.
  - “Graph query: top 5 pools by TVL; Dune query 12345 with params …”
- For execution, include wallet context when adapters require it.
  - “use Thirdweb wallet_ref=…; chain_id=8453”
- Keep long‑running operations staged: preview intent → preview quote → risk → execute.

## Example Prompts

- Research: “Get ETH price from Chainlink (Base), TVL for ethereum from DeFiLlama, and latest 10 trending words in sentiment.”
- Trade preview: “Quote 0.01 ETH to USDC on Base; include Chainlink reference; compute risk report.”
- Data check: “Run The Graph query for Uniswap V3 pools(first:2) id + TVL.”
