# Supported Protocols

<Info>
We prioritize integrations that maximize coverage and reliability for real users and teams. Selection favors protocols with outsized adoption, deep liquidity (TVL), proven security, stable APIs, and broad ecosystem impact.
</Info>

## Selection Rationale

- Adoption & usage: strong DAU/MAU, active addresses, query volume, aggregator coverage.
- Liquidity & market impact: sustained TVL share across chains and deep market depth.
- Ecosystem centrality: high composability, SDK/support in major dev tools, and broad downstream usage.
- Security posture: reputable audits, active bug bounty, transparent incident history and disclosures.
- API operability: versioned, well‑documented endpoints with predictable limits and stable schemas.
- Multi‑chain coverage & standards: EVM/Solana/Bitcoin where relevant, standard ABIs, typed events/logs.
- Data integrity: on‑chain verifiability, reference checks (e.g., Chainlink), reproducible results.
- Sustainability: active maintenance, open roadmaps, and responsive governance/community.

## Integration Criteria

Protocols are queued for integration when they meet most of the following guardrails:

- TVL and share: ≥ $100M TVL or top‑20 in category for ≥ 90 days.
- Availability: ≥ 99.9% 30‑day uptime; p95 read latency ≤ 500 ms; graceful rate limiting.
- Security: ≥ 1 reputable audit in the last 12 months; public bounty; no unresolved criticals.
- Versioning & deprecation: semantic versions, change logs, and ≥ 90‑day deprecation windows.
- Documentation & schema: public docs, OpenAPI/ABI where applicable, typed/paginated responses.
- Observability: status page, incident comms, rate‑limit headers, and test/sandbox endpoints.
- Multi‑chain readiness: consistent contract behavior across chains; stable addresses or registries.
- Licensing & terms: programmatic access permitted under reasonable terms of use.
