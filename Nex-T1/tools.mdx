# Tools

## Built‑in

- DuckDuckGo search tool included and bound to the LangGraph agent by default.
  - Location: `app/core/langgraph/tools/duckduckgo_search.py`
  - Registration: `app/core/langgraph/tools/__init__.py` (edit `tools` list)

## MCP Adapters (selected)

- Research: The Graph (`research_thegraph.py`), Dune (`research_dune.py`), CoinGecko (`research_coingecko.py`), DeFiLlama helpers via integrations.
- EVM: Chainlink (`evm_chainlink.py`), Uniswap/0x (`evm_uniswap.py`), Thirdweb Wallet (`evm_thirdweb.py`).
- Exchanges: Binance typed helpers (`integrations/mcp/binance_helpers.py`).
- Solana: Jupiter quote/execute (`sol_jupiter.py`).
- Bitcoin: Bitcoin MCP adapter (`integrations/mcp/bitcoin.py`).

These adapters support MCP servers via env vars and often include direct HTTP fallbacks for development.

## Add a New Tool

1) Create a `BaseTool` subclass in `app/core/langgraph/tools/`.
2) Export it from `app/core/langgraph/tools/__init__.py` and add to the `tools` list.
3) Optionally expose a dedicated endpoint that uses the tool for easier user access.

<Info>
To bind MCP adapters as agent tools, import and add them to the `tools` list. Ensure inputs/outputs are compact strings or structured content that fits the chat flow.
