- Proof-of-inference recording
- Verifier attestation
- Slashing mechanisms
- Role-based access control (SLASHER_ROLE, REPUTATION_ROLE, ORACLE_ROLE, VERIFIER_ROLE, TASK_MODULE_ROLE)

### Tasks Contract
- Task lifecycle (Open → Claimed → Submitted → Completed/Disputed/Cancelled)

## Usage

These files are ready to be integrated into the Nexis Mintlify documentation site at:
`https://docs.nexis.network/ai-ml/`

Each file follows Mintlify best practices and includes:
- Proper frontmatter with title, description, and icon
- Component-based layout (Cards, CodeGroups, Accordions)
- Cross-linking between related pages
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Visual diagrams using Mermaid
- Security warnings and tips
- Next steps navigation

## Navigation Structure

The mint.json file already includes the AI/ML section:
```json
