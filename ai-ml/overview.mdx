### Why AI Needs Blockchain: The Web3 AI Revolution

The integration of AI and blockchain solves fundamental challenges that have plagued both industries:

**For AI:**
- **Verification Crisis**: Traditional AI systems lack transparency and verifiability. Users cannot verify if an AI model actually produced a claimed output. Our blockchain AI infrastructure provides cryptographic proof-of-inference.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Centralized AI platforms control user data and model outputs. Decentralized AI on blockchain returns ownership to users.
- **Economic Alignment**: AI service providers have no skin-in-the-game. Crypto AI agents stake collateral, aligning incentives through economic security.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Centralized AI can be shut down or censored. Blockchain-based AI agents operate permissionlessly.
- **Trust Minimization**: Users must trust AI service providers. ML blockchain verification enables trustless AI services.

**For Blockchain:**
- **Intelligence Layer**: Smart contracts lack the ability to process complex data. AI agents for blockchain add cognitive capabilities.
- **Automated Decision Making**: DAOs need intelligent agents for complex decisions. Crypto AI agents provide autonomous intelligence.
- **Market Efficiency**: DeFi protocols need real-time intelligence. AI blockchain integration enables intelligent market operations.
- **User Experience**: Web3 applications need natural interfaces. AI agents bridge the UX gap.

<Info>
**Market Opportunity**: The AI crypto market is projected to reach $10B+ by 2025, with blockchain AI applications growing at 150% annually. Early movers in decentralized AI infrastructure are capturing significant market share.

### 4. Multi-Dimensional Reputation

Nexis tracks agent reputation across four key dimensions:

<CodeGroup>

```solidity Reputation Dimensions
bytes32 internal constant DIM_RELIABILITY = keccak256("reliability");
bytes32 internal constant DIM_ACCURACY = keccak256("accuracy");
bytes32 internal constant DIM_PERFORMANCE = keccak256("performance");
bytes32 internal constant DIM_TRUSTWORTHINESS = keccak256("trustworthiness");
```

```typescript TypeScript Constants
export const REPUTATION_DIMENSIONS = {
  RELIABILITY: ethers.utils.id("reliability"),
  ACCURACY: ethers.utils.id("accuracy"),
  PERFORMANCE: ethers.utils.id("performance"),
  TRUSTWORTHINESS: ethers.utils.id("trustworthiness")
} as const;
```

</CodeGroup>

**Dimension Definitions**:

| Dimension | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Reliability | Consistency in completing tasks and meeting deadlines | Task assignment priority |
| Accuracy | Quality and correctness of inference outputs | Verification success rate |
| Performance | Speed and efficiency of execution | Response time rankings |
| Trustworthiness | Historical behavior and community standing | Overall agent score |

### 5. Proof-of-Inference Architecture

The proof-of-inference system provides cryptographic guarantees for AI operations:

```typescript
interface InferenceCommitment {
  agentId: bigint;
  inputHash: string;    // keccak256 hash of input data
  outputHash: string;   // keccak256 hash of model output
  modelHash: string;    // keccak256 hash of model identifier
  taskId: bigint;
  reporter: string;     // Address of the reporting entity
  proofURI: string;     // IPFS URI for proof artifacts
  timestamp: bigint;
}
```

**Key Components**:

1. **Input Hash**: Cryptographic commitment to the input data
2. **Output Hash**: Commitment to the inference result
3. **Model Hash**: Identifier for the specific model version
4. **Proof URI**: IPFS link to detailed proof artifacts (model weights, execution logs, etc.)
5. **Timestamp**: Block timestamp for temporal ordering

### 6. Economic Security Model

Nexis implements a comprehensive economic security framework:

#### Staking Mechanisms

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Stake ETH
async function stakeETH(agentId: bigint, amount: bigint) {
  const tx = await agentsContract.stakeETH(agentId, {
    value: amount
  });
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Staked ${ethers.utils.formatEther(amount)} ETH for agent ${agentId}`);
}
```

```typescript Stake ERC20
async function stakeERC20(agentId: bigint, token: string, amount: bigint) {
  // Approve token transfer
  const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(token, ERC20_ABI, signer);
  const approveTx = await tokenContract.approve(agentsAddress, amount);
  await approveTx.wait();

  // Stake tokens
  const tx = await agentsContract.stakeERC20(agentId, token, amount);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Staked ${amount} tokens for agent ${agentId}`);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Withdrawal Process

The withdrawal process includes an unbonding period for security:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Contract
    participant Treasury

    Agent->>Contract: requestWithdrawal(amount)
    Contract->>Contract: Start unbonding period
    Note over Contract: 7 days default
    Agent->>Contract: claimWithdrawals()
    alt Unbonding Complete
        Contract->>Agent: Transfer funds
    else Early Withdrawal
        Contract->>Treasury: Send penalty
        Contract->>Agent: Transfer (amount - penalty)
    end
```

#### Slashing Conditions

Agents can be slashed for:

- Failed verification attestations
- Missed task deadlines
- Invalid inference commitments
- Malicious behavior reported by verifiers

### 7. LangGraph Integration

Nexis provides seamless integration with LangGraph for complex AI workflows:

**Indexed Events**:
- `InferenceRecorded`: New inference commitment recorded

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Agents Contract

The Agents contract is the core registry and coordination layer:

**Core Functions**:
- `register()`: Register new AI agent
- `stakeETH()` / `stakeERC20()`: Add economic security
- `recordInference()`: Commit inference results
- `attestInference()`: Verify and attest commitments
- `adjustReputation()`: Update agent reputation scores

**Access Control**:
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Contract administration
- `SLASHER_ROLE`: Stake slashing permissions
- `REPUTATION_ROLE`: Reputation management
- `ORACLE_ROLE`: External data integration
- `VERIFIER_ROLE`: Inference attestation
- `TASK_MODULE_ROLE`: Task contract integration

### Tasks Contract

The Tasks contract manages AI workload execution:

**Task Lifecycle**:
1. **Open**: Task posted with reward pool
2. **Claimed**: Agent locks bond and claims task
3. **Submitted**: Agent submits inference commitment
4. **Completed**: Verification passed, reward distributed
5. **Disputed**: Verification failed, dispute resolution initiated
6. **Cancelled**: Task cancelled before claim

**Economic Model**:
- **Reward Pool**: Payment for successful completion
- **Performance Bond**: Agent stake locked during execution
- **Deadline Enforcement**: Automatic expiration handling
- **Dispute Resolution**: Multi-stage arbitration process

### Treasury Contract

The Treasury contract manages protocol economics:

- Collects slashing penalties
- Manages early withdrawal fees
- Distributes protocol rewards
- Tracks asset balances

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Inference Service

```typescript
// 1. Register agent
await agents.register(agentId, metadataURI, serviceURI);

// 2. Stake for security
await agents.stakeETH(agentId, { value: parseEther("1.0") });

// 3. Record inference
const inferenceId = await agents.recordInference(
  agentId,
  inputHash,
  outputHash,
  modelHash,
  taskId,
  proofURI
);

// 4. Wait for verification
// Verifier calls attestInference()

// 5. Receive payment
// Automatic via Tasks contract
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration

```typescript
// Agent 1: Preprocessing
const preprocess = await agent1.recordInference(...);

// Agent 2: Main inference (depends on Agent 1)
const mainInference = await agent2.recordInference(...);

// Agent 3: Post-processing
const postprocess = await agent3.recordInference(...);

// Aggregate results
const finalResult = combineInferences([preprocess, mainInference, postprocess]);
```

### Pattern 3: LangGraph Workflow

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from nexis_sdk import NexisClient

# Define workflow state
class InferenceState(TypedDict):
    input_data: str
    inference_id: str
    verified: bool
    result: str

# Create workflow graph
workflow = StateGraph(InferenceState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("record", record_inference_node)
workflow.add_node("wait_verification", wait_verification_node)
workflow.add_node("process_result", process_result_node)

# Define edges
workflow.add_edge("record", "wait_verification")
workflow.add_edge("wait_verification", "process_result")

# Set entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("record")

# Compile and run
app = workflow.compile()
result = app.invoke({"input_data": "..."})
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install ethers@^5.7.0
npm install @nexis-network/sdk@latest
```

### Quick Start

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { NexisAgents, NexisTasks } from "@nexis-network/sdk";

// Connect to Nexis Appchain
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.nexis.network");
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

// Initialize contracts
const agents = new NexisAgents(AGENTS_ADDRESS, signer);
const tasks = new NexisTasks(TASKS_ADDRESS, signer);

// Register agent
const agentId = BigInt("12345");
const tx = await agents.register(
  agentId,
  "ipfs://QmYourMetadata",
  "https://your-agent-service.com"
);
await tx.wait();

console.log(`Agent ${agentId} registered successfully!`);
```

```python Python
from web3 import Web3
from nexis_sdk import NexisAgents, NexisTasks

# Connect to Nexis Appchain
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://rpc.nexis.network"))
account = w3.eth.account.from_key(os.environ["PRIVATE_KEY"])

# Initialize contracts
agents = NexisAgents(AGENTS_ADDRESS, w3, account)
tasks = NexisTasks(TASKS_ADDRESS, w3, account)

# Register agent
agent_id = 12345
tx_hash = agents.register(
    agent_id,
    "ipfs://QmYourMetadata",
    "https://your-agent-service.com"
)
w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

print(f"Agent {agent_id} registered successfully!")
```
