# Nexis Security Bug Bounty Program

The security of Nexis Appchain and its users is our highest priority. We partner with the security research community to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. **The Nexis Bug Bounty Program rewards researchers who discover and responsibly disclose security issues.**

<Info>
**Program Status**: Active and accepting submissions as of January 2025.
**Total Rewards Paid**: Program launching - be among the first researchers!

### PoC Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Exact contract addresses, function names, parameter values
2. **Be Reproducible**: Anyone should be able to run your PoC
3. **Be Safe**: Don't actually exploit mainnet or steal funds
4. **Be Clear**: Comment your code explaining each step
5. **Show Impact**: Demonstrate the concrete harm (e.g., "steals $X")

## Severity Classification

We use the following matrix to determine severity:

### Impact Levels

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Direct theft, permanent loss, protocol insolvency | Drain all staked funds, mint unlimited tokens, steal bridge deposits |
| **High** | Indirect theft, temporary loss, major disruption | Steal unclaimed rewards, freeze user funds temporarily, force invalid state |
| **Medium** | Griefing, minor loss, degraded UX | Block stuffing DoS, spam events, incorrect accounting (non-exploitable) |
| **Low** | Edge cases, minor issues | Contract doesn't handle zero values, poor error messages |

### Likelihood Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **High** | Easily exploitable by any attacker with no special access |
| **Medium** | Requires specific conditions or timing |
| **Low** | Requires privileged access or highly unlikely conditions |

### Severity Matrix

|                | Critical Impact | High Impact | Medium Impact | Low Impact |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **High Likelihood**   | 🔴 Critical     | 🟠 High      | 🟡 Medium     | 🔵 Low      |
| **Medium Likelihood** | 🟠 High         | 🟡 Medium    | 🔵 Low        | 🟢 Info     |
| **Low Likelihood**    | 🟡 Medium       | 🔵 Low       | 🟢 Info       | 🟢 Info     |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I report the same issue to multiple bug bounty platforms?">
    No. Choose one platform. If reporting via Immunefi or other platform, that platform's rules apply. Direct reports to security@nexis.network use these terms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I find something but I'm not sure it's exploitable?">
    Report it anyway! We'd rather receive false positives than miss a real issue. Worst case, we thank you and classify it as informational.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I test on mainnet?">
    No. Use testnet or local forks. If you must test on mainnet for a reproducible PoC, contact us first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do I need to wait before public disclosure?">
    90 days from our fix deployment, or earlier with mutual agreement. We respect your right to disclose but ask you coordinate with us.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if you disagree with my severity assessment?">
    We'll provide detailed reasoning. If you disagree, we can seek neutral third-party arbitration (details in full program terms).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I submit anonymously?">
    Yes, but you must provide an ETH address for payment and complete KYC for rewards $10,000+. We can keep your identity confidential in public disclosures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if two researchers submit the same bug?">
    First valid submission wins full bounty. Second submission may receive 10% courtesy payment if submitted within 24 hours.
