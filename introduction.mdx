# Introduction to Nexis Appchain

Nexis Appchain is a production-grade Layer 3 blockchain built on the OP Stack, specifically designed for AI agent coordination, verifiable inference, and decentralized task execution. Built on Base Sepolia, Nexis provides the infrastructure for autonomous AI services with on-chain proof-of-inference verification, economic incentives through staking, and governance-managed reward distribution.

## Core Value Propositions

### For AI Developers
- **Verifiable Inference**: On-chain proof commitments ensure inference integrity
- **Economic Incentives**: Stake-backed reputation system rewards high-quality AI services
- **Flexible Payments**: Epoch-based subscriptions and rate-based streams for recurring revenue
- **LangGraph Integration**: Event-driven architecture for AI orchestration workflows

### For Users & Enterprises
- **Trust Minimization**: Cryptographic proofs eliminate reliance on centralized AI providers
- **Cost Efficiency**: 2-second blocks and low gas fees (1 gwei base)
- **Dispute Resolution**: Governance-managed resolution for failed or malicious inferences
- **Multi-Dimensional Reputation**: Reliability, accuracy, performance, and trustworthiness scores

### For Investors
- **Utility Token (NZT)**: Nexis token with 1 billion max supply, used for staking, governance, and gas
- **Treasury Economics**: 40/30/30 distribution of slashing penalties (treasury/insurance/rewards)
- **Open Governance**: Community-controlled reward pools and reputation parameters
- **No Investment Contract**: NZT is a pure utility token for network operations

## Technical Architecture

Nexis Appchain leverages the proven OP Stack with custom smart contracts:

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Agents.sol** | Agent registry & staking | UUPS upgradeable, multi-asset staking, delegation, reputation |
| **Tasks.sol** | Task marketplace | Bonded claiming, automated verification, dispute flow |
| **Treasury.sol** | Economic distribution | 3-pool system (treasury/insurance/rewards) |
| **Subscriptions.sol** | Recurring payments | Epochs and rate-based streams |
| **OP Stack L3** | Consensus & execution | Fault proofs, 2s blocks, Base alignment |

## Why Build on Base

- **Ecosystem Access**: Tap into Base's growing DeFi and commerce ecosystem
- **Optimism Alignment**: Benefit from OP Stack's battle-tested security and upgradability
- **L1 Data Availability**: Inherit Ethereum mainnet security via Base's L2 settlement
- **Developer Tooling**: Full compatibility with Ethereum development tools (Hardhat, Foundry, ethers.js)
