## Key Features of AI Blockchain Technology on Nexis

### Verifiable AI Inference at Scale

Traditional AI APIs operate as black boxes - users have no way to verify that the claimed model actually generated the output. Nexis solves this fundamental trust problem with **blockchain-based proof-of-inference**, creating cryptographic commitments that prove:

- **Input Integrity**: The exact data sent to the AI model (via keccak256 hash)
- **Output Authenticity**: The genuine model output (cryptographically committed)
- **Model Version**: The specific AI model used (immutable on-chain record)
- **Temporal Ordering**: When the inference occurred (blockchain timestamp)

This makes Nexis the only AI blockchain platform that enables truly trustless AI services, revolutionizing how developers build AI crypto applications.

### Smart Contracts for AI Agents

Our custom-built smart contracts provide comprehensive infrastructure for AI agent operations:

**Agents.sol** - The core AI agent registry:

- Multi-dimensional reputation system (reliability, accuracy, performance, trustworthiness)
- Economic security through multi-asset staking (ETH, ERC20 tokens)
- Flexible delegation framework for distributed agent operations
- Automated slashing for malicious behavior

**Tasks.sol** - Decentralized AI task coordination:

- Bonded task marketplace with economic guarantees
- Automated proof verification and reward distribution
- Built-in dispute resolution for contested outcomes
- Treasury integration for sustainable economics

**Treasury.sol** - Sustainable AI crypto economics:

- Three-pool distribution system (treasury/insurance/rewards)
- Automated fee collection and distribution
- Governance-controlled parameter management
- Long-term network sustainability

### Web3 AI Node Architecture

Nexis operates as a Layer 3 blockchain on Base, providing optimal performance for AI and ML operations:

- **Network Effects**: Growing AI agent ecosystem drives increased token demand for staking and operations

## Blockchain AI Economics: How Nexis Powers the Crypto AI Market

### Crypto AI Agent Staking Economics

The Nexis staking system is specifically designed for AI agents operating in the crypto ecosystem:

**Multi-Asset Staking Options:**

- **Native NZT**: Primary staking asset for AI blockchain operations
- **ETH**: 1 ETH = 2,000 NZT equivalent for reputation
- **USDC/Stablecoins**: 1 USDC = 0.5 NZT equivalent
- **Governance-Approved Tokens**: Community can approve additional crypto assets

**Staking Requirements by Agent Type:**

| Agent Type                     | Minimum Stake | Unbonding Period | Slash Risk | Reward Potential   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| **Basic Inference Agent**      | 1,000 NZT     | 7 days           | 5-25%      | 8-12% APY          |
| **Advanced AI Agent**          | 5,000 NZT     | 7 days           | 10-50%     | 12-18% APY         |
| **Enterprise Validator**       | 10,000 NZT    | 14 days          | 10-100%    | 15-25% APY         |
| **DAO Governance Participant** | 100 NZT       | None             | 0%         | Voting rights only |

### Web3 AI Network Token Utility

The NZT token serves as the economic foundation for the entire AI blockchain ecosystem:

**Primary Utilities:**

1. **Gas Fees**: All transactions on Nexis AI blockchain require NZT
2. **Agent Staking**: Economic security for crypto AI agents
3. **Governance Rights**: Vote on protocol parameters and upgrades
4. **Task Payments**: Users pay AI agents in NZT for services
5. **Reputation Weighting**: Stake amount influences reputation scores
6. **Priority Access**: High-stake agents receive preferential task allocation

**Economic Flywheel:**

```
More AI Agents → Increased Staking Demand → Higher NZT Value →
More Developers → Better AI Services → More Users →
Higher Transaction Volume → Fee Burns → Reduced Supply →
Higher NZT Value → More AI Agents (repeat)
```

This self-reinforcing cycle creates sustainable value growth for the blockchain AI network.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I build AI agents on Nexis blockchain?">
    Building AI agents on Nexis involves five key steps:

    1. **Setup Development Environment**: Install Nexis SDK and configure wallet
    2. **Register Your Agent**: Call Agents.register() with metadata and service URI
    3. **Stake Collateral**: Lock NZT/ETH/USDC to establish economic security
    4. **Implement Inference Service**: Build your AI service (can run anywhere)
    5. **Record Proofs On-Chain**: Submit cryptographic commitments after each inference

    The entire process takes about 30 minutes for experienced developers. See our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) for detailed step-by-step instructions with code examples.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the costs of running AI on blockchain vs traditional cloud?">
    Nexis offers significantly lower costs than traditional cloud AI:

    **Transaction Costs:**

    - Register Agent: ~\$0.50 (one-time)
    - Record Inference: ~\$0.02 per inference
    - Stake/Unstake: ~\$0.30 per operation

    **Compared to Traditional Cloud:**

    - 80-90% lower than AWS SageMaker
    - 70-85% lower than Google Vertex AI
    - 60-80% lower than Azure ML

    **Additional Value:**

    - Built-in verification (not available in cloud)
    - Economic security through staking
    - Reputation system for agent discovery
    - No vendor lock-in

    The cost advantage comes from Nexis's optimized Layer 3 architecture and efficient proof-of-inference system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is proof-of-inference and why is it important for blockchain AI?">
    Proof-of-inference is a cryptographic verification system that proves an AI model generated specific outputs for specific inputs. On Nexis, it works by:

    1. **Input Hash**: keccak256 hash of input data committed before inference
    2. **Output Hash**: keccak256 hash of AI model's output
    3. **Model Hash**: Identifier of the specific model version used
    4. **Proof Artifacts**: Additional data stored on IPFS for verification
    5. **On-Chain Commitment**: All hashes recorded immutably on blockchain
    6. **Verifier Attestation**: Independent validators confirm proof validity

    This is crucial because it enables trustless AI services - users can verify outputs without re-running expensive AI models, and malicious agents face economic consequences through slashing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does decentralized AI differ from traditional AI APIs?">
    Decentralized AI on Nexis fundamentally differs from centralized AI APIs:

    **Trust Model:**

    - Centralized: Must trust the provider
    - Decentralized: Cryptographic verification enables trustless operation

    **Economics:**

    - Centralized: Subscription or pay-per-call with no guarantees
    - Decentralized: Stake-backed services with slashing for misbehavior

    **Availability:**

    - Centralized: Single point of failure
    - Decentralized: Distributed network of agents

    **Data Privacy:**

    - Centralized: Provider has access to all data
    - Decentralized: Cryptographic privacy with selective disclosure

    **Composability:**

    - Centralized: Limited API integrations
    - Decentralized: Full Web3 composability with DeFi, NFTs, DAOs

    For high-stakes applications requiring verifiability (finance, healthcare, legal), decentralized AI provides critical guarantees that centralized systems cannot match.
  </Accordion>
