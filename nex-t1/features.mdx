# Features

- FastAPI backend with async performance, CORS, security headers, validation handlers.
- Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards; health endpoints.
- LangGraph agent with OpenAI chat model binding and Postgres checkpointer (via `AsyncPostgresSaver`).
- Langfuse tracing for LLM/tool observability.
- JWT authentication, user + session tokens.
- Multi‑agent preview router for intent routing, quotes/execute, research, and risk.
- MCP adapters and direct HTTP fallbacks (The Graph, Dune, CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, Chainlink, Uniswap/0x, Thirdweb Wallet, Binance, Jupiter, Bitcoin).
- Config via `.env.*` and dynamic environment detection (`development`, `staging`, `production`, `test`).

Developer ergonomics
- Clear module boundaries: `api`, `core`, `models`, `schemas`, `services`, `utils`.
- Typed Pydantic models for requests and responses.
- Feature flags in `app/core/feature_flags.py` (e.g., `MULTI_AGENT_ENABLED`).
- Makefile targets for common workflows; Docker Compose for full stack.
