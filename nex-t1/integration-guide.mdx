# Integration Guide

## For Users (API Consumers)

1) Obtain credentials and create a session (see Get Started).
2) Choose your flow:
   - Chat: `/api/v1/chatbot/chat` or `/chat/stream`
   - Research: `/api/v1/multi-agent/research/preview`
   - Trading: `/api/v1/multi-agent/preview` → quote → risk → execute (EVM)

Security & reliability
- Rate limits apply; handle HTTP 429 with backoff.
- Validate responses and timeouts; endpoints return structured JSON per Pydantic schemas.

## For Developers (Extending)

Agent & tools
- Add tools in `app/core/langgraph/tools/` and include them in `tools`.
- Inspect the `LangGraphAgent` in `app/core/langgraph/graph.py` for tool binding and message flow.

Multi‑agent
- Extend team graphs under `app/core/langgraph/multi/teams/*`.
- Routing via `SupervisorRouter` in `app/core/langgraph/multi/supervisor.py`.

MCP integrations
- Implement adapters in `app/core/langgraph/tools/mcp` and helpers in `app/core/integrations/mcp`.
- Configure via env vars; add typed helper endpoints for common operations.

Configuration
- `app/core/config.py` handles env detection and settings. Prefer `.env.development` etc. and never commit secrets.

Observability
- Prometheus `/metrics`, health `/health`, and Langfuse tracing via `LANGFUSE_*` env vars.

Deployment
- Makefile + Docker Compose for local stack; Railway and Kubernetes examples in repo docs.

<Warning>
Gate dev‑only endpoints (like `/quote/evm/pseudo`) behind flags in production. Enforce allowlists and add receipt verification.
</Warning>
