# Disclaimers & Legal

- Preview endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/multi-agent/quote/evm/pseudo`) are for development; gate behind feature flags and remove/lock in production.
- MCP integrations rely on external services and credentials. Follow provider terms and secure all tokens.
- Validate inputs rigorously and sanitize user data; rate limit sensitive endpoints.
- For on‑chain execution, verify receipts, add idempotency, and enforce token/contract allowlists.
- This documentation reflects the referenced codebase. Adapt configurations, limits, and security to your environment.
