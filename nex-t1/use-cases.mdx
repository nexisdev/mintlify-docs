# Use Cases

<Info>
Nex‑T1 provides a foundation for both end users (consuming APIs) and developers (extending agents, tools, and MCP adapters).
</Info>

- Research assistants
  - Run subgraph queries (The Graph), Dune jobs, DeFiLlama TVL/prices, and sentiment lookups in a single request.
  - Endpoint: `/api/v1/multi-agent/research/preview`.

- Trading previews (EVM/Solana)
  - Fetch quotes and simulate trades using Uniswap/0x and Jupiter adapters; execute via Thirdweb/EVM Wallet MCP.
  - Endpoints: `/api/v1/multi-agent/preview`, `/api/v1/multi-agent/quote/evm/pseudo` (dev only), `/api/v1/multi-agent/execute/evm`.

- Risk management
  - Compute configurable risk thresholds (e.g., allowed tokens, expected price vs Chainlink reference) before execution.
  - Endpoint: `/api/v1/multi-agent/risk/preview`.

- Exchange market data
  - Subscribe to Binance spot data via MCP, list/invoke tools; unsubscribe when done.
  - Endpoints: `/api/v1/multi-agent/binance/*`.

- General agent chat
  - Single‑agent chat with a default DuckDuckGo search tool bound; extendable with more tools.
  - Endpoints: `/api/v1/chatbot/chat`, `/api/v1/chatbot/chat/stream`.

Developer extensions
- Add new tools in `app/core/langgraph/tools` and bind to the agent.
- Add/replace MCP adapters in `app/core/langgraph/tools/mcp` and `app/core/integrations/mcp`.
- Expand multi‑agent teams in `app/core/langgraph/multi/teams/*`.
