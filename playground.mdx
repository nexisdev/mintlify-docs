<Note>
This playground is generated from the OpenAPI spec in `/openapi.json`. Use the sidebar to explore endpoints and send requests live.
</Note>


### Quick Try

Use the inline playground below to call a couple of common endpoints. For the full experience with all routes, open the dedicated Playground.

<a href="/api">Open Full API Playground →</a>

<Tip>
Use the Base URL switcher at the top of the API playground to choose between your local API (`http://localhost:8000`) and production (`https://nex-t1.ai`). If you use a different production API host, let us know and we’ll update the config.
</Tip>

<Note>
Most endpoints require JWT bearer auth. First, call the login endpoint to obtain a token, then click “Set Authentication” in the playground and paste `Bearer <your_token>`.
