# Tokenomics Overview

Nexis Token (NZT) is the native utility token of the Nexis Appchain ecosystem. NZT powers all network operations including staking, governance, gas fees, and economic coordination between AI agents, validators, and users.

<Warning>
**Important Disclaimer**: NZT is a utility token designed exclusively for network operations. It is NOT an investment contract, security, or promise of financial returns. NZT holders should not expect profits from the efforts of others. The token's sole purpose is to facilitate decentralized AI agent coordination and verifiable inference on the Nexis Appchain.
</Warning>

</CardGroup>

### 1. Gas Fees

All transactions on Nexis Appchain require NZT for gas fees following the EIP-1559 model:

```solidity Gas Fee Calculation
// EIP-1559 fee structure
function calculateGasFee(uint256 gasUsed) pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 baseFee = 1 gwei; // Minimum base fee
    uint256 priorityFee = 0; // Optional tip for sequencer

    uint256 totalFee = gasUsed * (baseFee + priorityFee);
    return totalFee;
}

// Example: Register agent costs
uint256 gasUsed = 250_000;
uint256 cost = gasUsed * 1 gwei = 0.00025 ETH equivalent in NZT
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- **70%** → BaseFeeVault (burned or redistributed)
- **20%** → SequencerFeeVault (sequencer operations)
- **10%** → L1FeeVault (Base L2 data availability costs)

See [Fee Structure](/tokenomics/fees) for detailed economics.

### 2. Staking

AI agents and validators must stake NZT to participate in the network:

| Role | Minimum Stake | Unbonding Period | Slashing Risk |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| **AI Agent** | 1,000 NZT | 7 days | 5-50% |
| **Validator** | 10,000 NZT | 14 days | 10-100% |
| **Governance Voter** | 100 NZT | None | None |
| **Task Claimer** | Variable | 24 hours | 100% of bond |

**Staking Benefits:**
- **Reputation Building**: Stake amount directly influences reputation score
- **Reward Eligibility**: Higher stakes earn proportionally more rewards
- **Governance Rights**: Vote weight proportional to staked amount
- **Priority Access**: High-stake agents get priority for task claims

**Multi-Asset Staking:**
Nexis supports staking multiple assets alongside NZT:
- **ETH**: 1 ETH = 2,000 NZT equivalent (oracle-based)
- **USDC**: 1 USDC = 0.5 NZT equivalent
- **Custom Tokens**: Governance-approved assets

```solidity Multi-Asset Staking Example
// Stake NZT + ETH for enhanced reputation
function stakeMultiAsset() external payable {
    address[] memory assets = new address[](2);
    assets[0] = NZT_ADDRESS;
    assets[1] = address(0); // ETH

    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);
    amounts[0] = 5000 * 1e18; // 5,000 NZT
    amounts[1] = 2 ether; // 2 ETH

    agentsContract.stake{value: 2 ether}(assets, amounts);

    // Effective stake: 5,000 + (2 * 2,000) = 9,000 NZT equivalent
}
```

See [Staking Economics](/tokenomics/staking) for detailed mechanics.

### 3. Governance

NZT holders govern the protocol through on-chain voting:

**Governance Powers:**
- **Parameter Updates**: Adjust staking requirements, slashing rates, emission schedules
- **Treasury Allocation**: Direct treasury funds to ecosystem grants and initiatives
- **Contract Upgrades**: Approve UUPS proxy upgrades for core contracts
- **Dispute Resolution**: Vote on disputed proof validations and slashing appeals
- **Emission Control**: Modify MintManager parameters and reward distribution

**Voting Mechanisms:**

```solidity Governance Voting
contract NexisGovernance {
    // Proposal structure
    struct Proposal {
        string description;
        bytes[] calldatas;
        address[] targets;
        uint256 forVotes;
        uint256 againstVotes;
        uint256 deadline;
        bool executed;
    }

    // Vote on proposal
    function castVote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
        uint256 votingPower = nztToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        require(votingPower >= MINIMUM_VOTE_THRESHOLD, "Insufficient NZT");

        if (support) {
            proposals[proposalId].forVotes += votingPower;
        } else {
            proposals[proposalId].againstVotes += votingPower;
        }

        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support, votingPower);
    }

    // Execute passed proposal
    function execute(uint256 proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp > proposal.deadline, "Voting ongoing");
        require(!proposal.executed, "Already executed");
        require(proposal.forVotes > proposal.againstVotes, "Proposal failed");

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            (bool success,) = proposal.targets[i].call(proposal.calldatas[i]);
            require(success, "Execution failed");
        }

        proposal.executed = true;
    }
}
```

**Voting Parameters:**
- **Proposal Threshold**: 100,000 NZT to create proposal
- **Quorum Requirement**: 5% of circulating supply must vote
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Execution Delay**: 2 days timelock after passage

### 4. Collateral & Bonding

Task claiming and dispute resolution require NZT bonds:

```javascript Task Bond Example
// Agent claims task with 10 NZT bond
const taskId = 42;
const bondAmount = ethers.parseEther("10"); // 10 NZT

await tasksContract.claimTask(taskId, {
  value: bondAmount
});

// If proof is valid: bond returned + reward
// If proof is invalid: bond slashed to treasury
```

**Bond Requirements by Task Type:**

| Task Type | Minimum Bond | Slash Rate | Reward Multiplier |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Simple Inference** | 5 NZT | 50% | 1.1x |
| **Complex Inference** | 20 NZT | 75% | 1.5x |
| **Multi-Step Task** | 50 NZT | 100% | 2.0x |
| **Dispute Challenge** | 100 NZT | 100% | 5.0x (if wins) |

### 5. Incentives & Rewards

Multiple mechanisms accrue value to NZT holders:

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Transaction Fees**: 70% of gas fees distributed to stakers
2. **Task Rewards**: 10% of task budgets go to agent stakers
3. **Slashing Penalties**: 30% of slashed funds go to reward pool
4. **Treasury Grants**: DAO-allocated ecosystem development rewards

**Reward Distribution Model:**

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

### Deflationary Pressure

Multiple mechanisms reduce NZT circulating supply:

1. **Fee Burning**: 35% of gas fees permanently burned (50% of 70% base fee)
2. **Slashing**: 40% of slashed tokens locked in treasury (effectively removed from circulation)
3. **Long-term Staking**: Average 30% of supply locked in staking contracts
4. **Governance Locking**: Proposed: lock NZT for up to 4 years for 4x voting power

**Burn Rate Estimation:**

```python
# Assuming 1M transactions per day at average 100k gas
daily_gas = 1_000_000 * 100_000 # 100B gas
daily_fees = daily_gas * 1e-9 # At 1 gwei = 100 ETH equivalent
base_fee_portion = daily_fees * 0.70 # 70 ETH
daily_burn = base_fee_portion * 0.50 # 35 ETH burned

# Annual burn rate
annual_burn_nzt = daily_burn * 365 * 2000 # Assuming 1 ETH = 2000 NZT
print(f"Annual burn: {annual_burn_nzt:,.0f} NZT")
# Output: Annual burn: 25,550,000 NZT (2.555% of total supply)
```

### Staking Yield

Expected staking yields vary based on network activity:

| Network Stage | Transaction Volume | Staking APY | Staking Ratio |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Launch (Year 1)** | Low (100k tx/day) | 5-8% | 20% |
| **Growth (Year 2)** | Medium (1M tx/day) | 8-12% | 30% |
| **Mature (Year 3+)** | High (10M tx/day) | 10-15% | 40% |

**Staking APY Calculation:**

```javascript
function calculateStakingAPY(
  totalStaked,      // Total NZT staked
  dailyFeeRevenue,  // Daily fee revenue in NZT
  slashingRevenue,  // Annual slashing revenue
  emissionRate      // Annual emission to stakers
) {
  // Annual revenue to stakers
  const annualFees = dailyFeeRevenue * 365 * 0.5; // 50% of base fees
  const annualSlashing = slashingRevenue * 0.3; // 30% of slashing
  const annualEmission = emissionRate;

  const totalAnnualRewards = annualFees + annualSlashing + annualEmission;

  const apy = (totalAnnualRewards / totalStaked) * 100;
  return apy;
}

// Example: Year 2 calculation
const apy = calculateStakingAPY(
  300_000_000,  // 300M NZT staked (30%)
  100_000,      // 100k NZT daily fees
  5_000_000,    // 5M NZT slashed annually
  40_000_000    // 40M NZT emission to stakers
);
console.log(`Staking APY: ${apy.toFixed(2)}%`);
// Output: Staking APY: 10.08%
```

### Network Effects

As Nexis adoption grows, NZT accrues value through:

1. **Increased Demand**: More AI agents need NZT to stake
2. **Higher Fees**: More transactions = more fee revenue to stakers
3. **Enhanced Utility**: New use cases expand NZT utility
4. **Reduced Supply**: Burning + staking lock reduces circulating supply

**Growth Scenarios:**

| Metric | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Active Agents (Year 3)** | 1,000 | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| **Daily Transactions** | 500k | 2M | 10M |
| **Avg Staking Ratio** | 25% | 35% | 50% |
| **Annual Burn Rate** | 1.5% | 2.5% | 5% |
| **Implied APY** | 6% | 10% | 18% |

## Economic Security Model

### Staking Security

The security of Nexis depends on economic guarantees:

**Attack Cost Calculation:**

```solidity
// Cost to compromise network
function attackCost() view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalStaked = nztToken.balanceOf(address(stakingContract));
    uint256 requiredStake = totalStaked * 51 / 100; // 51% attack

    uint256 slashRate = 50; // 50% slash for malicious behavior
    uint256 effectiveCost = requiredStake * slashRate / 100;

    return effectiveCost;
}

// Example: 300M NZT staked
// Attack cost: 300M * 51% * 50% = 76.5M NZT
// At $0.10/NZT = $7.65M attack cost
```

**Security Guarantees:**
- Attacking the network costs minimum 25% of total staked value
- Slashing disincentivizes rational malicious behavior
- Insurance pool compensates honest agents affected by attacks
- Governance can emergency-pause in extreme scenarios

### Liquidity & Market Making

Initial liquidity deployment:

| Venue | Allocation | Initial Price | TVL Target |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Uniswap V3** | 40M NZT + 2M USDC | $0.05 | $4M |
| **Aerodrome (Base)** | 30M NZT + 1.5M USDC | $0.05 | $3M |
| **Velodrome** | 20M NZT + 1M USDC | $0.05 | $2M |
| **CEX Reserve** | 10M NZT | Market | $500k |

**Price Discovery Mechanism:**
- No team or insider market making
- Liquidity provided at launch, locked for 6 months
- Price determined by open market supply and demand
- No buybacks or artificial price support

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

<Warning>
### Important Risks to Consider

**Market Risks:**
- **Volatility**: NZT price may fluctuate significantly
- **Liquidity**: Early markets may have low liquidity
- **No Guarantees**: No guaranteed returns or price appreciation

**Technical Risks:**
- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Contracts are audited but bugs may exist

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is NZT a security or investment contract?">
    **No.** NZT is a pure utility token designed for network operations. It is not an investment contract, security, or promise of financial returns. NZT holders should not expect profits from the efforts of others. The token's sole purpose is to facilitate decentralized AI agent coordination on Nexis Appchain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the max supply of NZT?">
    The maximum supply is **1,000,000,000 NZT** (1 billion). This is a hard cap enforced by the smart contract and cannot be increased without governance approval and a new token contract deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is NZT distributed?">
    40% community rewards, 20% ecosystem fund, 15% team/advisors (4-year vest), 10% liquidity, 10% strategic reserve, 5% public sale. See distribution table above for full details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I stake NZT without running an AI agent?">
    Yes. You can delegate your NZT to existing AI agents and earn a portion of their rewards without running infrastructure. Delegators typically earn 70-90% of agent rewards depending on the delegation terms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the expected staking APY?">
    Staking APY is dynamic and depends on network activity. Expected range is 5-15% annually, derived from transaction fees, slashing penalties, and emission rewards. Higher network usage = higher APY.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to burned NZT?">
    Burned NZT is sent to a null address (0x000...dead) and permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary mechanism increases scarcity over time as network usage grows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can governance change tokenomics parameters?">
    Yes. Governance can adjust staking requirements, emission schedules, fee distribution, and other parameters via on-chain voting. However, the max supply of 1B NZT cannot be changed without deploying a new token contract.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the unbonding period for unstaking?">
    Standard unbonding is **7 days** for NZT and ETH, **3 days** for stablecoins. Early exit is possible with a **5% penalty** (default, governance-adjustable). See [Staking](/tokenomics/staking) for details.
